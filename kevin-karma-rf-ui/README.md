Figma Design: [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/d1wxLbe0tu13im0HzCqDGD/RainFocus-UI-Challenge?type=design&node-id=502%3A85&mode=design&t=8DSnB59HKvYJUJMQ-1).

### Instruction:
The included design reflects examples of information and interactions we use inside each of our products. We would like you to build a single page application using React or HTML and SASS compiled CSS (please provide your sass folder in your deliverables). Using “create react app” is completely acceptable. Please do not use any AI assist tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or other LLMs. You can export the icons/images from the Figma file attached in the email. We’d like you to build the page as you see it in the Figma design. You may add additional functionality as you see fit, but it is not required.

The page should be full width on a normal desktop and responsive down to 320px. For the layout, please do not use bootstrap, tailwind, or other styling libraries. We want to see your own styling ability to create your own style set. We understand there have been changes to Figma, if you cannot see the exact sizes please do your best to measure based on a 1024px page size.
Once completed, please follow these steps:
Compile and export to a build folder that includes an index.html file.
Remove your node-modules folder.
Zip your whole project (src and build) and email it to RainFocus. 
Title your zip file “firstname-lastname-rf-ui”.
Write instructions on how to run your app if applicable in some kind of readme file.

We should be able to unzip, load the index.html file into the browser, and see the completed work without having to build ourselves. Alternatively, if it is easier, save your project in a code sandbox then send us the link.If you are invited to a team interview, we’ll invite you to a zoom meeting and ask you to share your project with us through zoom. During the interview we’ll have you share your screen and update your project with edits like font sizes, colors, or widths to see how you work.
If you have any questions about these instructions, please reach out via email. We appreciate you taking the time to complete this assignment.
